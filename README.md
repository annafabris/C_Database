A Database written entirely in C.

## Usage
The project simulates the management of a Database using text files (.txt) for data storage. To test it's enought to compile everything with c99 and run `main.c`.

## Project structure
The project is structured in 3 folders:

- `data`, which contains the queries that will be executed when the program is run;
- `results`, which contains the output files generated by the program;
- `src`, which contains the program;

## About the Project

### Data storage
Each table of the Database will be stored in a different text file.

### Input Commands
- The management of each table of the Database will be done using commands in a language provided in the project specifications, which echoes the SQL syntax.
Here all the possible commands:
    - `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1_name,…)` 
    - `INSERT INTO table_name (column1_name,…) VALUES (value1,…)` 
    - `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1_name,…)` 
    - `SELECT * FROM table_name` 
    - `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1_name ASC`, instead of `ASC`, `DESC` can be used
    - `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition`, where condition can be `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=`
    - `SELECT column1_name,… FROM table_name` 
    - `SELECT column1_name,… FROM table_name WHERE condition`, where condition can be `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=`
    - `SELECT column1_name,… FROM table_name ORDER BY column2_name ASC`, instead of `ASC`, `DESC` can be used
    - `SELECT column1_name FROM table_name GROUP BY column1_name`
### Output
To represent the Database in the text files (output) the output is provided in the following way.
```c 
TABLE table_name COLUMNS column1_name,..; 
ROW value1,...;
ROW value2,...;
```

### Data
In order to better manage the database tables, we chose to rely on a data structure that consists in a dynamic array of pointers, each of which identifies an array of strings corresponding to the values of each column in the row.

Below an example of a possible table and how it is stored by the program.

| Surname |  Name |  Phone |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Bianchi | Mario | 123456 |
|  Rossi  | Paolo | 43215 |
|   ...   |  ...  |   ...  |
